      Hi, I'm Zack and I like building things. I spend a lot of time
      architecting abstractions, or deconstructing them to reveal the underlying
      truth about how systems and computers work. It gives me this hit of
      dopamine that I can't quite get anywhere else. Right now I'm building a
      Figma for video. When I'm not coding, I'm making music. My calendar's open
      for anyone who wants to chat: https://cal.com/zackoverflow.
