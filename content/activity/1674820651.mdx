With the recent experimental release of server components in [`next-mdx-remote`](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/releases/tag/v4.3.0), I am excited to convert my site back over to using `next-mdx-remote` from Contentlayer.

My co-worker [Bryce Kalow](https://twitter.com/brkalow) (lead maintainer of next-mdx-remote) and I will be recording a pairing session between the two of us where we implement next-mdx-remote server components within a Next.js project. We're planning on roughly one hour and by the end of the session, we should have a PR opened for you all to reference and ask questions about.
