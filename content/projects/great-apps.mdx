The App Store is filled with apps that just serve the purpose. They do what they are supposed to do, but they don't do it in a way that makes you want to use them. To value the apps that are created with love and passion in every detail, I created a concept for a collection of great apps worth using.


    <Image 
        src={`/projects/great-apps/preview.webp`}
        alt={`Preview screens`}
        width={593}
        height={305}
        caption="Preview screens"
    />



    <Image 
        src={`/projects/great-apps/cat.webp`}
        alt={`Categories for components`}
        width={593}
        height={305}
        caption="Categories for components"

    />



    <Image 
        src={`/projects/great-apps/sbm.webp`}
        alt={`Submit your beloved apps`}
        width={593}
        height={305}
        caption={`Submit your beloved apps`}
    />
