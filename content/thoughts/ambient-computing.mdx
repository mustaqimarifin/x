[Moment](https://momentjs.com/) is 4.35MB whilst [React Live Clock](https://pvoznyuk.github.io/react-live-clock/) added another 9.93 MB. I believe thats big as hell (woops). Some googling efforts led me to this wonderful site  

```jsx
import Clock from 'react-live-clock';  

export default function ClockWrapper() {
    return (
        <Clock 
            className='text-[8vw] leading-none'
            format={'h:mm A'}
            timezone='Asia/Kuala_Lumpur'
            ticking={true}
        />
    );
}  
```

setInterval(showTime, 60000)
function showTime() {
  let time = new Date()
  let hour = time.getHours()
  let min = time.getMinutes()
  let am_pm = 'AM'

  if (hour >= 12) {
    if (hour > 12) hour -= 12
    am_pm = 'PM'
  } else if (hour == 0) {
    hour = 12
    am_pm = 'AM'
  }

  hour = hour < 10 ? 0 + hour : hour
  min = min < 10 ? 0 + min : min

  let currentTime = hour + ':' + min + ':' + am_pm
  //@ts-ignore
  document.getElementById('clock').innerHTML = currentTime
}
showTime()
```

```js

As we enter a new era of technology, ambient computing emerges as a powerful force, seamlessly integrating technology into our surroundings and connecting humans on a deeper level. This innovative field transcends traditional computing by embedding capabilities into everyday environments, operating discreetly in the background to anticipate our needs. As a result, ambient computing paves the way for more natural, intuitive, and efficient interactions between humans and technology, redefining interfaces for a new era.
                    
Ambient computing can help us achieve greater mindfulness, improved work-life balance, personalized experiences, and heightened environmental awareness. As ambient computing becomes more prevalent, we can anticipate a more conscious and meaningful existence, where technology serves as an enabler rather than a barrier. By seamlessly integrating technology into our environments, we can look forward to a future where we are more connected and fulfilled.
                    
As we continue to innovate and explore the potential of ambient computing, itâ€™s essential to keep human values and well-being at the forefront of our endeavors. By doing so, we can ensure that the dawn of ambient computing leads to a brighter, more connected, and more fulfilling future for all.
